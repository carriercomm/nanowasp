notes for successful compilation:

- makez80.c must be modified so it generates
a section name of text instead of text32.
search for section in makez80.c and modify
as appropriate.  if the section is called
text32, segfaults occur.


- bug in makez80.c:
otir, etc. decrement B at the start.  this is wrong.


- comment out the rccore/types.h include in mz80.h
