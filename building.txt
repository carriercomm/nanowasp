
Building Nanowasp (mostly) with Visual C++ 2005 Express
=======================================================

1. Install VC++ Express and the Platform SDK.  For details see:
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/

2. Install and build wxWidgets.  Nanowasp 2.0b was compiled with
   wxWidgets 2.8.4 using Libs/wxWidgets/setup.h.  For details see:
   http://www.wxwidgets.org/wiki/index.php/MSVC_.NET_Setup_Guide

3. Unpack the libdsk tarball in the Libs directory and apply
   the patch (e.g. "cd libdsk-1.1.12; patch -p 1 < ../libdsk-nanowasp.patch").
   Build using the VC project file (libdsk-1.1.12\win32vc6\libdsk.dsw).

4. Generate the Z80 emulation code by executing "make" in 
   Source/Z80/codegen/.  For this I use the GNU tools from
   MinGW/MSYS.  Note that the code generation requires the
   regex package.  Download at:
   http://www.mingw.org/
   
5. Build nanowasp using the VC project file.  Currently the wxWidgets
   path is hardcoded so you may need to update it to match your
   installation.


Building cpmtools
=================

1. Unpack the tarball in the Utils directory, extract the extra files in the
   patch zip (replacing the originals from the tarball where appropriate),
   apply the patch from the zip (e.g. "cd cpmtools-2.6; 
   patch < cpmtools-microbee.patch").

2. Build using "nmake /f Makefile.msc" (this requires that libdsk has been
   built already as described above).
