2002.01.28 - put the disk image access routines into a separate module to
             make it easier to write tools to work with the disk image,
             and to make it easier to change the disk image file format.

2002.01.28 - updated display refresh code so that full screen redraws
             are *a lot* less frequent.  this should have a significant
             impact on running speed.

2002.01.20 - switched to autoconf

2001.10.05 - changed from Allegro to SDL for graphics, etc. to assist in
             porting to Linux.  the code is not yet optimised for SDL but
             it runs ok.  fixed a bug that resulted in segfaults when
             compiled with mingw-gcc (due to a typecast that shouldn't have
             been there -- *that* was fun to debug).
 
2001.07.04 - initial floppy disk controller emulation completed.  this version
             doesn't implement the write sector or format track instructions.
             the code is a bit hacked up at the moment, mostly making sure
             things work at the moment.  the next version should be more robust
             and complete.
 
2001.01.05 - completely rewrote the CRT controller and display code.  the
             old code was much too slow (it emulated nearly every detail
             of the CRTC exactly).  The new version isn't near as accurate,
             but everything should still run OK (not that you can tell 'cause
             there's no floppy disk controller yet :P).  Also, it now runs
             a great deal faster, and I haven't optimised memory writes yet.
 
2000.12.27 - initial release
